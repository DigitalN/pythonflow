# Developing Pythonflow

Notes for building Pythonflow from source and publishing releases. For installing and
using it, see the [README](README.md). The architecture and the rules the code follows
are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Build from source

You need Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the pinned
packages in `Application Files/requirements.txt` (`First Time Setup.command` installs
them). Then:

```bash
scripts/install.sh
```

This builds `Pythonflow.app`, signs it with your **Apple Development** certificate,
installs it to `/Applications` and launches it. `Build Pythonflow.command` does the same
after pulling the latest code and running the tests.

Without a certificate the build is signed ad hoc: it works, but it can't update itself.
A free Apple ID is enough to get one: Xcode → Settings → Apple Accounts → sign in →
select your **Personal Team** → Manage Certificates… → **+** → **Apple Development**.

Builds go to `~/Library/Caches/Pythonflow-build`, not the repository. Folders synced by
iCloud Drive (such as `~/Documents`) add Finder metadata to app bundles, and codesign
rejects bundles that have it.

To run from source without building:

```bash
cd "Application Files" && python3 main.py
```

Set `PYTHONFLOW_DATA_DIR=/some/folder` to run against a throwaway data folder. Run the
tests with `python3 -m pytest`.

## Release checklist

Go through all of it for every release. Releases are public, and installed copies update
themselves from the latest one, so a mistake reaches everyone. Merging a pull request
doesn't release anything: the download links only change when a release is published.

### Before building

- [ ] Everything going out is merged into `main`, and the local `main` matches GitHub
  (`git pull`).
- [ ] `VERSION` in `Application Files/main.py` is raised. The build copies it into the
  app's `Info.plist`. It must be higher than the latest release, or installed copies
  won't update.
- [ ] `python3 -m pytest` passes.
- [ ] The signing certificate is valid and not about to expire:
  `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` lists an *Apple Development* identity from
  the same team as the last release (`XT4LT7MS6Y`). Installed copies refuse updates
  signed by any other team.
- [ ] The README matches what's shipping: install steps, features, privacy.

### Build and check the disk image

- [ ] `scripts/package.sh` makes `dist/Pythonflow-<version>.dmg`. That's the only file a
  release has: people download it, and installed copies update from it.
- [ ] Open the DMG: Pythonflow and Applications with the arrow between them, and the
  first-launch card at the bottom easy to read.
- [ ] The app inside has the new version, a valid signature, and the right team:
  ```bash
  M=$(hdiutil attach -nobrowse -readonly -noautoopen dist/Pythonflow-1.1.0.dmg | grep -o '/Volumes/.*$')
  defaults read "$M/Pythonflow.app/Contents/Info" CFBundleShortVersionString
  codesign --verify --deep --strict "$M/Pythonflow.app" && codesign -dvv "$M/Pythonflow.app" 2>&1 | grep TeamIdentifier
  hdiutil detach "$M"
  ```

### Test updating, if the updater, packaging or signing changed

- [ ] A test copy updates to a higher-version build from a stand-in release (see
  *Testing the updater* below): it downloads, swaps, and relaunches in the background.
- [ ] It refuses a build changed after signing, a build signed ad hoc or by another team,
  and a release whose tag is newer than the app inside it.
- [ ] Afterwards, the test copy, its data folder and the test disk images are deleted.

### Publish

- [ ] Release notes: what's new in this version, then the README's Install section. Only
  the current version: no notes for people on older versions.
- [ ] Publish it, tagged `v<version>`, from the commit it was built from:
  ```bash
  gh release create v1.1.0 dist/Pythonflow-1.1.0.dmg --title "Pythonflow 1.1.0" --notes-file notes.md
  ```
  Drafts and pre-releases are skipped by the updater, so publish a pre-release first to
  try a build before everyone gets it.
- [ ] Turn the previous release into a draft, so the page lists only the current one.
  This hides it without deleting it: `gh release edit v1.0.0 --draft=true`.

### After publishing

- [ ] `https://github.com/DigitalN/pythonflow/releases/latest` goes to the new tag.
- [ ] GitHub's API, which the updater reads, shows the new tag with only the `.dmg`:
  ```bash
  curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/DigitalN/pythonflow/releases/latest | grep -E '"tag_name"|"name": "Pythonflow'
  ```
- [ ] The DMG downloaded from the page is identical to the one in `dist/`
  (`shasum -a 256`).
- [ ] An older installed copy picks it up: choose **Check for Updates…** in its menu bar
  menu, or wait for the next wake. `app.log` shows `Downloading`, `ready to install`, then
  `Installed <version>; relaunching`.

### Signing

Releases are signed with a free Apple Development certificate. They aren't notarized by
Apple, so people have to click **Open Anyway** the first time (see Install in the
README). Development certificates last a year, so package a new release with a fresh
certificate from the same Apple account before the old one expires.

## How updates work

`Application Files/updater.py`, ported from Side Tabs' updater:

- **When:** once a day, the first time the Mac wakes from sleep (a minute after waking,
  so the network is back). A day counts once GitHub has answered; if the Mac was offline,
  the next wake tries again. **Check for Updates…** in the menu checks right away.
- **What:** GitHub's
  [latest release](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release),
  through `/usr/bin/curl` (the bundled Python has no certificates of its own). Drafts and
  pre-releases don't count. If its tag is newer, it downloads the release's `.dmg`.
- **Checks:** copies `Pythonflow.app` out of the disk image and runs
  `codesign --verify --deep --strict` with the requirement
  `identifier "com.pythonflow.monitor" and anchor apple generic and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = "<this copy's team>"`.
  The version inside must also be newer than the installed one.
- **Installing:** at a quiet moment (dashboard closed, no charge being recorded, no
  keyboard or mouse input for 10 seconds), it swaps the new app in with one
  `replaceItemAtURL` call and relaunches it in the background (`--background`, so the
  dashboard doesn't pop up).
- **Off** for copies that run from source, aren't team-signed, aren't in an Applications
  folder, or can't replace themselves. Settings says why, and **Check for Updates…**
  opens the releases page instead.

## Testing the updater

Test with a separate copy that has its own bundle identifier, so it can't touch the
installed Pythonflow and Launch Services doesn't mix the two up.

1. Build, then make the test copy and a higher-version update from it, each re-signed
   with your certificate after editing its `Info.plist`:
   ```bash
   APP=$(scripts/build.sh)
   ID=$(security find-identity -v -p codesigning | awk '/"Apple Development/ {print $2; exit}')
   mkdir -p /tmp/pf-update /tmp/pf-feed
   copy() {  # destination version
     ditto "$APP" "$1"
     /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :CFBundleIdentifier com.pythonflow.monitor.test" \
       -c "Set :CFBundleShortVersionString $2" -c "Set :CFBundleVersion $2" "$1/Contents/Info.plist"
     codesign --force --deep -s "$ID" "$1"
   }
   copy "$HOME/Applications/Pythonflow Test.app" 1.0
   copy /tmp/pf-update/Pythonflow.app 9.9
   hdiutil create -volname Pythonflow -srcfolder /tmp/pf-update -format UDZO /tmp/pf-feed/Pythonflow-9.9.dmg
   ```
2. Write a stand-in for GitHub's latest-release response whose `.dmg` asset's
   `browser_download_url` is a `file://` URL, e.g. `/tmp/pf-feed/latest.json`:
   ```json
   {"tag_name": "v9.9", "assets": [{"name": "Pythonflow-9.9.dmg",
     "browser_download_url": "file:///tmp/pf-feed/Pythonflow-9.9.dmg"}]}
   ```
3. Give the test copy its own data folder. Keep its dashboard closed and its history off,
   and keep it out of Login Items:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/pf-data && touch /tmp/pf-data/.open-at-login-default-applied
   echo '{"open_dashboard_at_launch": false, "record_history": false}' > /tmp/pf-data/settings.json
   open -n --env PYTHONFLOW_DATA_DIR=/tmp/pf-data --env PYTHONFLOW_UPDATE_FEED=file:///tmp/pf-feed/latest.json \
     "$HOME/Applications/Pythonflow Test.app"
   ```
   Choose **Check for Updates…** in the test copy's menu (it installs right away), or
   sleep and wake the Mac (it waits for a quiet moment). The signature check still applies.
   `/tmp/pf-data/Logs/app.log` shows `Downloading 9.9`, `9.9 is ready to install`, then
   `Installed 9.9; relaunching`.
4. To check that bad updates are refused, change the update's `Info.plist` after it's
   signed, re-sign it with `codesign --force --deep -s -`, or sign it with another bundle
   identifier. Each should log `Update check failed` and leave the test copy alone.
5. Clean up: quit the test copy, then delete it, `/tmp/pf-data`, `/tmp/pf-update` and
   `/tmp/pf-feed`.

The updater mounts the disk image in `/Volumes`, hidden from Finder: mounted anywhere
else, macOS's file access protection stops the app from reading it. The first mount of a
freshly written image sometimes fails with "Resource temporarily unavailable" and leaves
it attached with no volume; the updater detaches it and tries again. `hdiutil attach` is
deprecated in macOS 27 in favor of `diskutil image attach`; it still works.
